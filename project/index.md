## Abstract

- [ ] describe M.S. symptoms and causes, treatment options, (brief)
- [ ] desribe how to resolve the problem (using AI)
- [ ] describe what I want my data to obtain
- [ ] describe what the problem is

**Keywords:** tensorflow, example. 

## 1. Introduction

- [ ] extend the discreption that was put in abstract (can be a paragraph each)
- [ ] do a brief discription about the data set 
- [ ] thorougly describe what the problem is 
 










## 3. Using Images

![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].

 steps to insert picture
 1. download picture to computer
 2. Upload image into repository
 3. Change path to what I saved picture as on github
 4. Create a description for the image 


   
## 4. Datasets

Datasets can be huge and GitHub has limited space. Only very small datasets should be stored in GitHub.
However, if the data is publicly available you program must contain a download function instead that you customize.
Write it using pythons `request`. You will get point deductions if you check-in data sets that are large and do not use
the download function.
- [ ] look on google or kaggle to find dataset 
- [ ] http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&id=1017&show_dataset=E-GEOD-21942.  look on this website! find this first
- [ ] describe the dataset found
- [ ] mode, median, mean (can calculate this to add into section)

## 5. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
- [ ] define method that will be used to study the performance of the proposed method 
 
## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 7. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.  can put instructors

## 8. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.
